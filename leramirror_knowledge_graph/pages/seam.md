- a seam is a modifier over a single value or a set of values.
- if that value is sounding in the current [[channel]], or just ending, it will be extended without re-articulation.
- if that value is not sounding in the current channel, it will be rearticulated

- **precedence**
	- if a non-seam and a seam value begin at the same time on the same channel, the value should be both overlayed and re-articulated.
