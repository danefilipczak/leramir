- an outline of interpretation steps
	- **compute an ast from an era**
		- **structural steps**
			- parse eras
				- TODO extend to ignore seams
			- add effective tags to grafts
			- TODO rewrite wings as seams over the relevant values (only passing through effective eras)
			- TODO parse seams into normal values with special metadata
		- add paths
		- percolate attributes
		- calculate time
			- applies scale and shift
	- **compute channels from ast**
		- retrieve a seq of the values for each channel
		- normalize set-values - they each get their own
		- **overlaps and seams** - there is probably a clever way to do this
			- merge overlapping values using the overlap rule
				- a seam and a non-seam that start at the same place resolve to a non-seam
			- apply seams
